# rust_cipher
v0.0.0 (are u serious?)

This repo are for those who seek to understand Rust <br />
programming language and basic cryptography. <br />
<br />
This is an attempt to provide educational value <br />
to those who run around self-studying stuff and had hit on a "technical" wall. <br />
<br />
Comments for functions and methods will be heavily used, <br />
and a lot of printing will occur on how the code encrypts a message.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This repo is made by someone who has not taken the<br />
conventional programming career path and who's keen<br />
on giving back to the open source community that helped him<br />
in his endeavors.<br />
Also this someone is bugging some Rust developer,<br />
to help him improve his coding in Rust.<br />
<br />

### Would-be Features
- taking of path of the message to be encrypted
- encryption key
- encrypts using a simple Caeser Cipher method
